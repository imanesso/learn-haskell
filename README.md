# Learn Haskell
The goal of this repository is to summarize what I have learned about functional programming in Haskell. Later it will serve me as a reference book, but it can also be understood as a tutorial for programmers who have primarily worked with imperative programming languages.

# Document

The document is in german as there are plenty of tutorials in english and I also find it easier to express myself in german.
The document is hosted with github-pages and will be accessible under the following link:
